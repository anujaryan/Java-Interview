Why HashMap should not be used in multi threaded environment? 
Can it cause infinite loop as well?
When get method go to infinite loop in HashMap?
Ans.
Well, nothing is wrong â€” it depends on how you use it. For example, if you initialize the HashMap with just one thread and all threads are only reading from it, then it's perfectly fine.

One example of this is a Map that contains configuration properties. The real problem starts when at least one of those threads is updating the HashMap, i.e. adding, changing, or removing any key-value pair.

Since a put() operation can cause re-sizing, which can further lead to infinite loop, that's why either you should use a Hashtable or ConcurrentHashMap 

What is Rehashing?

 
Default capacity of HashMap is 16 and Load factor is 0.75, which means HashMap will double its capacity when 13th Key-Value pair enters in map (16 * 0.75 = 12).

Till 12th Key-value pair, Hashmap will keep putting items in map and as soon as you try to put 13th key-value pair, rehashing process starts. 

Load factor: Load factor is a measure "Till what load, hashmap can allow elements to put in it before its size is increased.


Rehasing reverses ordering of the nodes 
In Rehashing process, 
Hashmap creates a New Array(Buckets) of double size first.
Hashmap transfers key-value pairs from Old buckets to New buckets.  
Key-value pairs will be reversed in New buckets because Hashmap will add key-value pairs at the start in the New bucket and not at the end. 
Hashmap adds new key-value pairs at start to avoid traversing linked list every time and keep constant performance.
