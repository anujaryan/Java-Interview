1.A logarithmic algorithm — O(logn)
Runtime grows logarithmically in proportion to n.
A linear algorithm — O(n)
Runtime grows directly in proportion to n.
A superlinear algorithm — O(nlogn)
Runtime grows in proportion to n.
A polynomial algorithm — O(nc)
Runtime grows quicker than previous all based on n.
A exponential algorithm — O(cn)
Runtime grows even faster than polynomial algorithm based on n.
A factorial algorithm — O(n!)
Runtime grows the fastest and becomes quickly unusable for even
